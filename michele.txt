Michele Laurelli — AI Architect, Researcher, and Founder of Algoretico

Michele Laurelli approaches artificial intelligence with a rare dual perspective: deep technical mastery and visionary product design. As Founder and CEO of Algoretico, he develops custom AI architectures, autonomous systems, and on-premise “private AI” solutions for organizations that require absolute control, performance, and intellectual property ownership. His work spans nuclear fusion, industrial automation, medical imaging, fintech, and advanced enterprise systems.

Founder of Algoretico — Building Private AI, Not Just Using It

Since 2018, Michele has led Algoretico in designing and developing state-of-the-art AI systems, including:

Talents, a breakthrough concept introducing persistent neural layers that shape how AI models learn, specialize, and excel in specific domains

Maestro, the first European patented architecture for orchestrating autonomous AI agents

You Need No Data, a framework for self-supervised AI training that allow to train AI models with minimal or no data at all

SPaaS – Software Production as a Service, a pioneering AI-driven software factory model

Algoretico builds AI for real-world impact: controlling proton-boron fusion reactors, diagnosing medical images, automating industrial workflows, and powering enterprise-grade CRMs and RAG systems. Under Michele’s leadership, the company has partnered with major players in fusion energy, steel, dental imaging, and next-gen industrial robotics.

AI Researcher and Innovator

Michele’s scientific work bridges frontier research with applied engineering. He has published influential papers on:

Autonomous control systems for nuclear fusion

Concept erasure and GDPR-compliant LLMs (“Brain Surgery”)

Adaptive Meta-Domain Transfer Learning (AMDTL)

Novel AI architectures and training frameworks

His innovations include PoAItry (world’s first Italian poetry neural network), DNART.io (AI art generated from human genome data), and multiple systems for emotion recognition, COVID-19 detection, and industrial sensor fusion.

Professor of Artificial Intelligence

Michele teaches Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing at:

Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele (Milan)

Istituto Italiano di Criminologia (Vibo Valentia)

Università Europea di Roma (Rome)

His teaching philosophy combines scientific rigor with hands-on engineering, preparing students to build — not just use — AI systems.

Advisor in Energy, Industry, and Research

Michele serves as:

Consultant for AI & Fusion at the European Fusion Association

CTO at Lagiste23, advising on investments in high-impact technologies

Expert member at Institut EuropIA, supporting European projects in AI ethics and innovation

He collaborates with stakeholders across Europe and Asia, bringing practical AI innovation into sectors historically resistant to technological transformation.

Author

Michele has written several books that make advanced AI accessible to a broader audience, including:

Alchimia (2024)

Intelligenza Artificiale e Criminologia (2023)

La Matematica dell’Intelligenza Artificiale (2023)

Beyond the Lab

Born in 1991 in Albenga, Michele combines his passion for AI with sailing, fencing, and long walks with his Border Collie.
